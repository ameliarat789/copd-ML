This dataset is a comprehensive collection of patient data focused on predicting health outcomes, particularly in the context of respiratory conditions such as COPD. The dataset includes a rich variety of features, categorized into two main types: environmental factors and lifestyle factors.

Environmental Features: These include data points related to the patients' surroundings, such as temperature, air quality, and other environmental conditions that can significantly impact respiratory health. This section captures the influence of external conditions on patient outcomes.

Lifestyle Features: This includes information about patients' habits and behaviors, such as smoking status, exercise frequency, and other lifestyle choices that are known to affect overall health and well-being. These factors provide insights into how individual behaviors contribute to health risks.

This dataset is ideal for training machine learning models aimed at predicting patient outcomes, recommending care levels, and improving healthcare decision-making. By leveraging both environmental and lifestyle data, this dataset offers a holistic view of the factors influencing patient health, making it a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals.
